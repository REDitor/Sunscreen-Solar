            <h1>Solar Panels Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                Charles Fritts created the first commercial solar panel, which was reported by Fritts as continuous,
                constant and of considerable force not only by exposure to sunlight, but also to dim daylight. However,
                these solar panels were very inefficient, especially compared to coal-fired power plants. In 1939,
                Russell Ohl created the solar cell design that is used in many modern solar panels. This design was
                first used to create the first commercially viable silicon solar cell. After that the process of silicon
                surface passivation by thermal oxidation was developed. The surface passivation process has since been
                critical to solar cell efficiency.

            <h1>Charge Controller</h1>
            <p>
                A charge controller, charge regulator or battery regulator limits the rate at which electric current is
                added to or drawn from electric batteries. It prevents overcharging and may protect against overvoltage,
                which can reduce battery performance or lifespan and may pose a safety risk. It may also prevent
                completely draining a battery, or perform controlled discharges, depending on the battery technology, to
                protect battery life. The name "charge controller" or "charge regulator" may refer to either a
                stand-alone device, or to control circuitry integrated within a battery pack, battery-powered device, or
                battery charger.

            <h1>Battery System</h1>
            <p>
                A home battery system stores surplus solar power for later use. The solar battery extends the use of a
                PV-system’s generated energy and will provide free, sustainable power even when the sun is not shining
                and the panels don’t produce energy.
                Therefore, with a solar battery little to no electricity is fed into the grid while also avoiding having
                to buy expensive electricity from the grid later. Due to the increased self-consumption, the electricity
                costs decrease significantly.
                With a battery system the excess solar power produced during the day can be used when it is actually
                needed.

            <h1>Direct Current Power</h1>
            <p>
                Direct current (DC) is the one directional or unidirectional flow of electric charge. An electrochemical
                cell is a prime example of DC power. Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire, but can
                also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. The
                electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current.
                Direct current may be converted from an alternating current supply by use of a rectifier which allows
                current to flow only in one direction. Direct current may be converted into alternating current via an
                inverter.

            <h1>Solar Inverter</h1>
            <p>
                A solar inverter or PV inverter, is a type of electrical converter which converts the variable direct
                current output of a photovoltaic solar panel into a utility frequency alternating current that can be
                fed into a commercial electrical grid or used by a local, off-grid electrical network. It is a critical
                balance of system (BOS)–component in a photovoltaic system, allowing the use of ordinary AC-powered
                equipment. Solar power inverters have special functions adapted for use with photovoltaic arrays,
                including maximum power point tracking and anti-islanding protection.

            <h1>Alternating Current Power</h1>
            <p>
                Instantaneous power in an electric circuit is the rate of flow of energy past a given point of the
                circuit. In alternating current circuits, energy storage elements such as inductors and capacitors may
                result in periodic reversals of the direction of energy flow.
                The portion of power that, averaged over a complete cycle of the AC waveform, results in net transfer of
                energy in one direction is known as active power. The portion of power due to stored energy, which
                returns to the source in each cycle, is known as instantaneous reactive power, and its amplitude is the
                absolute value of reactive power.
